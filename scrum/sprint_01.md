# Sprint Planning

Date/Time: 4/23/2024 @ 3:00PM

Participants: Reed, Hassan, Ivan, Andy

Goal Statement: 
``` 
-Get an initial idea of what we want to do for our Project.3 as a team.
-Deciding on what ONE Database we will use [prevent more confusion][No SQL Lite]
-Note we will have 'two branches' at the end of our project, before deployment. a 'Main' working branch and 'Dev' unstable branch.
```

During planning we discussed doing a simplified 'Twitter'-styled communication app. 
Where Users can sign up/sign in and can access and post things to their own 'home' pages and then have a feed where they can see posts from other users also using the app. We want to create Use-Cases and Class diagrams, and get our repository initially setup with README.md, and all those initial files, so we can start working on this project as a team ASAP, all from the same foundation.

# Daily Scrums

Ivan has setup our user-stories, class diagram, and use-cases for this project, and we have Hassan's initial commit in the repository from which we are going to be working from. We have developed a strong idea of where we want our project to go, and making sure we hit all the requirements

# Sprint Review

Participants: Reed, Hassan, Ivan, Andy, Alex

We have gotten started on a good foundation for our project, created our user-stories and covered which ones we need to get done to start making progress on this whole project. We want to try and cover the first 4 user-stories by next scrum.

Although, this was mainly just initial setup and planning for our project, things have gone really well, and we are all on the same page of what we want our application to do, keep it simple but hit all the marks we need.
