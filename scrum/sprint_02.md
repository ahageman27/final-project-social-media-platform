# Sprint Review

## Date/Time: 5/05/2024 @ 7:30pm  AND ALSO ON 5/07/24 @7:30pm

Participants: Reed, Ivan, Hassan, Andy,

#### Overview:
```
- Got all of our user-stories done
- Have our repository created and being worked on and updated with all the correct and working data
- Adjustments were made to database to allow compatibility for the dockerfile to work properly
```

We are currently working on touching up the finalized code, making sure we hit all the requirements, and then have a testing phase Ivan, Andy, and Alex will go through. Once we are done with that it will be the one last 'final submission' commit push to our main 'stable' branch, and we are done.

 
# Sprint Retrospective

## Date/Time: 5/09/2024 @ 8:00pm

Participants:  Hassan, Reed, Ivan, Andy, Alex

## What's gone well:
```
- We have absolutely nailed it with this project with the time-restriction we had to finish it.
- Everyone contributed and we were definitely more organized and efficient as a team during this project
```

## What hasn’t gone well, any obstacles:
```
-We run into some confusion with the dockerfile
- We also had some confusion over utilizing code we did not learn this year, but we able to make properly adjustments so the code would make more sense for everyone working on it.
- Time restraint and finals made the sprints/scrums feel a bit more rushed than we'd like
```

## What's our next move:
```
- have one final meeting together as a team on 5/10/24 to make sure everything is in working order for submission.
- Make sure the 'dev' branch is 100% working and updated to push fully into the main 'stable' branch.
- Touch up the code and repository as needed.
- Implement a testing phase of the application
- Do a final check of all the requirements
- Make sure the Professor can access our repository
- Push & Commit 'final submission' and be DONE!
```
